I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics & Astronomy and the Department of Mathematics at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I received my B.S. from Northwestern University, and I received a Master’s of Advanced Study in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in the Part III program at Cambridge. I received my Ph. D. from Caltech in 2017, and I did postdoctoral work with [Adilson Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University, [Jason Green](https://jasonrgreen.net/) at the University of Massachusetts Boston, and [Nathan Kutz](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/) and [Steve Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/) at the University of Washington.

My research focuses on the emergence of complexity, with particular emphasis on synchronization and pattern formation in networks, condensed matter, and fluid mechanical systems. I utilize classical tools from applied mathematics and novel machine learning (ML) approaches to discover and characterize mechanisms behind complex phenomena. Current topics of interest are ML-enabled system identification and reduced order modeling, symmetry concepts (including chimera states, dimension reduction methods, and converse symmetry breaking), band-gap design and associated complex phenomena such as localized states and anharmonic responses, and the kinetics of disordered systems, including oscillator and spin glasses, granular materials, and patterns of topological defects.
